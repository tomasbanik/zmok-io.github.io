# FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) 

## How does Front-running work? Can I save on gas fess and be the first at the same time?
With Front-Running your transaction will be picked and processed by miners very fast, on average in some milliseconds. The next thing is how it will be prioritised in the block.

Some miners on the Ethereum chain, like Ethermine, use non-conventional ordering for their benefit, aka they generally don't do the by-gas sort. Other miners can choose to sort by gas and nonce, others can choose to sort by gas and first-seen-time, others can first sort by gas and then randomise the order, others can sort by gas first and then put the "greatest" sender addresses at the top or bottom, which is converting an address to a 160-bit integer and working with those values.

If you’ll get to miners first with calculated or higher gas, you can be more than sure you’ll get it. If there will be any other user with ZMOK’s Front-Running extension, and you have a lower Gwei, there is a higher chance the other user will get the priority. Therefore we do not recommend lowering Gwei.
If you do not use a Front-Running endpoint, your transaction will be sent as a standard transaction to only one node, in only one region, and the chance that this transaction will be mined in the next block is lower, even if you’d use much higher gas.

## How much does the Front-Running extension help in terms of getting your transaction picked up before others?
Your transaction will be picked and processed by miners very fast, on average in some milliseconds. This means will be picked before others almost every time (99.9% is our internal measurement).

## Let’s say, the current rapid Gwei is 150, NFT is going to public drop, once the dev flips active. If the next block comes in at 200 Gwei(climbing towards 500) would my 240 Gwei send make it into the next block?
In this case, you must check on the pending transactions and based on that watch the max one, and with the same nonce submit again:

## Is Front-Running necessary for minting NFTs?
Not really, a basic paid plan shall be enough.
